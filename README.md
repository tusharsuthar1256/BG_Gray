# Image Background Customizer

## Overview

The **Image Background Customizer** is a React web application that allows users to upload an image, where the subject (person) retains its original color settings while the background is transformed into black and white. Users can further customize the background with adjustable settings for **blur**, **contrast**, **grayscale**, and **opacity**. The application uses Firebase for Google authentication to ensure secure access.

- **Person/Subject Retention**: The person or subject in the image retains its original color, while the background is processed separately.
- **Background Customization**: Users can apply various effects to the background:
  - Black and White effect.
  - Adjust **Blur**, **Contrast**, **Grayscale**, and **Opacity** levels.
- **Real-Time Preview**: Changes are applied in real-time, allowing users to immediately see the effects.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple interface with sliders to adjust customization options.
